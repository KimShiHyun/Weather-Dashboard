## About The Project

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionalty by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

This repository contains the code for a Weather Dashboard. This Weather Dashboard website uses Third-party APIs to access [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The Weather Dashboard uses `localStorage` to store any persistent data.
